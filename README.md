# TunTun-AI-Chatrbot
#Neo4j #Prologue #AIML
📦 Project Overview
This is a hybrid AI chatbot built on AIML, Prolog, and Neo4j. It blends rule-based chat (AIML) with logic programming (Prolog) and graph‑based knowledge (Neo4j) for richer, context‑aware conversations.

🎯 Key Components & Their Roles
AIML Rules (aiml files/)

Standard AIML patterns/templates for handling conversational intents. Think of it like classic chatbot brains.

Prolog Rules (prolog/)

Implements logical inference (e.g., “if X then Y” rules).

Adds reasoning beyond simple pattern matching.

Templates (templates/)

Predefined message formats (like email responders or structured replies).

Neo4j Integration (neo_test.py)

Connects to a Neo4j graph DB to store/query relationships and hierarchies.

Example: "Alice is Bob's friend" edges.

Main Logic (main.py)

Core orchestrator: channels user input to AIML, possibly Prolog, fetches context from Neo4j.

Combines results into a final reply.

POS Tagging (pos_tags.py)

Part-of-speech tagger using something like NLTK or spaCy. Helps understand query structure.

Download Helper (download.py)

Utility to fetch or update models/resources (AIML sets, Prolog files, templates).

Requirements (requirements.txt)

Lists dependencies (likely include neo4j, pyswip for Prolog, AIML parser, spaCy/NLTK).

🔧 Dependencies
Expect these in requirements.txt:

neo4j (or py2neo)

pyswip or similar for Prolog integration

AIML interpreter (e.g. python-aiml)

NLP library (spaCy/NLTK)

Any helper libs

🧩 Running the Bot
Set up Neo4j: Run the DB, import seed data if needed.

Install Python deps: pip install -r requirements.txt

Download resources: python download.py

Launch the bot: python main.py

Chat: It uses AIML first; if unmet patterns exist, it falls back to Prolog + Neo4j logic.

✅ Suggested Enhancements
Error handling: check missing AIML patterns, graph connection failures.

Logging: add logging to see flow through AIML → Prolog → Neo4j.

Tests: unit tests for Prolog rules and graph queries.

Dockerfile: simplify deployment by containerizing Neo4j + Python.

Bot UI: wrap main.py behind a web or chat interface (Flask, Telegram, etc.).
